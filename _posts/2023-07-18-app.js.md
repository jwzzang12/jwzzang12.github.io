The `_app.js` file in Next.js is a special file used to customize the default behavior of the application's root component. It serves as the entry point for configuring.

- The entry point
- Located in the `/pages` directory.
- Exports a custom `App` component that extends Next.js' built-in `App` component.
- Acts as a wrapper for all other pages and components.
- Allows you to apply global styles, set up context providers, configure server-side rendering, handle state management, and more.
- Common use cases:
  1. Global CSS: Import global CSS files or CSS-in-JS solutions (e.g. `styled-components`) to apply styles to all pages. (cf. index.js canâ€™t import css)
  2. Layouts: Define a layout component to provide a consistent structure/design for all pages (e.g. headers, footers, navigation menus).
  3. Server-side Rendering: Implement hooks or methods to fetch and pre-populate data before rendering the initial page for improved performance and SEO.
